# **Simple speciation scenarios scripts and datasets**
The folder contains the following files:

SNP_Traits_Subsets.ipynb -  python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation for subsamples of the full SNPs and traits matrices simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

SpDel_SNP_Traits_MissingSamples.ipynb - python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios with missing data inserted in all data from a percentage of samples.

SpDel_SNP_Traits_MissingValues.ipynb - python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios with missing data inserted as a percentage of values scattered accross the matrix.
