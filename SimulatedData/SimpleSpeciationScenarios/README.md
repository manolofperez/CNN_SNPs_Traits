# **Simple speciation scenarios scripts and datasets**
The folder contains the following files:

simulate_ms_SNP_trees_CNN.py - python script to simulate coalescent trees and segregating sites (saved as NumPy arrays)
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

SpDel_SNP_Traits.ipynb -  python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

SimulateTraits.R - R script to simulate traits from the simulated coalescent trees.

Subsets_MissingData_withOutputs - Folder containing python notebooks for the results obtained in subsamples and also for missing data inserted in the original SNP and trait matrices simulated under the simple speciation scenarios
