# **Simple speciation scenarios scripts and datasets**
The folder contains the following files:

simulate_ms_SNP_trees_CNN.py - python script to simulate coalescent trees and segregating sites (saved as NumPy arrays)
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

SpDel_SNP_Traits.ipynb -  python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

SpDel_SNP_Traits_MissingSamples.ipynb - python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios with missing data inserted in all data from a percentage of samples.

SpDel_SNP_Traits_MissingValues.ipynb - python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios with missing data inserted as a percentage of values scattered accross the matrix.

SimulateTraits.R - R script to simulate traits from the simulated coalescent trees.

TrainedModels - Folder containing all the trained models resulting from running the training notebooks.
