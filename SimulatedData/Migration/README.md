# **Scripts and datasets for the simulations including migration**
The folder contains the following files:

simulate_ms_SNP_trees_CNN_M.py - python script to simulate coalescent trees and segregating sites (saved as NumPy arrays)
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

SpDel_SNP_Traits_Migration.ipynb -  python notebook containing code and outputs for training and cross-validation 
for the simulated dataset under the simple speciation scenarios.

TrainedModels - Folder containing all the trained models resulting from running the file "Migration_WeightedAverage_Test_SNPs_Traits.ipynb".
