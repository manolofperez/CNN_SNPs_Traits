# CNN_SNPs_Traits
scripts from "Integrative taxonomy using traits and genomic data for species delimitation with deep learning". We present a deep learning approach for species delimitation that combines convolutional neural networks and multilayer perceptrons to integrate both genomic data (thousands of loci or single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and trait information into a unified framework. Scripts and notebooks are presented for the simulated and empirical datasets, and each folder contains a README file explaining its contents.
